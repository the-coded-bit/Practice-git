A place where I can brush my git/github skills.
**`Note: this repo is used for documenting my experiments with version control..`**

### what I learned
1. > ***git clone url dirname.***
clones the remote repo into dirname.
2. how to keep features branch up to date.  
    > git checkout dev
  git pull
  git checkout feature/$1
  git merge dev
  git push
